## Movitation
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.  The term “heart disease” refers to several types of heart conditions. In the United States, the most common type of heart disease is coronary artery disease (CAD), which can lead to heart attack.

- What are risk factors that may cause heart disease?
- What's your risk level for heart disease? 
- How can you greatly reduce risk for heart disease through lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medicine? 

## Data Design
- Review and clean the data
- Explore the data to identify the key factors
- Build up the classificaiton model to predict the probability for heart disease
- Run the model to indicate the risk level
- Based the risk level, provide the meaningful information to end user(s)

## Data Exploration

- Heart disease can happen at any age, but the risk goes up as you age.
